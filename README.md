# market_simulator
This code represents a simple investment simulation game where the player (represented by the Player class) can buy and sell assets in different markets to earn money and increase their reputation. The Market class simulates the performance of various markets and their fluctuations over time, while the Transaction, Asset, and Portfolio classes are used to keep track of the player's transactions and portfolio of assets.

The Client class represents a client that the player can accept, which has a certain investment principle, profit amount, reward, and deadline. The player earns reputation points by fulfilling the client's investment goal before the deadline, but loses reputation points if they fail to do so.

The player can also collect a client's investment amount and profit if they achieve the investment goal, which can be used to buy more assets or accept more clients. If the player is unable to meet the investment goal, the client's reward is cut in half and the player loses reputation points.

Overall, the player must balance their investments in different markets, manage their portfolio of assets, and accept clients with realistic investment goals in order to earn the most money and reputation points.
